                Rough.js is a small (9kB gzipped) graphics library that lets you draw in a sketchy, hand-drawn-like,
                style. The library defines primitives to draw lines, curves, arcs, polygons, circles, and ellipses. It
                also supports drawing SVG paths.

                Rough.js works with both Canvas and SVG.
